# Recipe Calories

Recipe Calories is a React-based web application where users can explore recipes, manage their cooking schedule, and track nutrition information seamlessly. Designed with a responsive layout, this project combines interactive elements to make cooking organization both fun and efficient.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: Leveraging components, JSX, props, conditional rendering, `useState`, and `useEffect` hooks for dynamic state and UI management.
- **Tailwind CSS & Daisy UI**: Providing a sleek and responsive design, aligned with Figma guidelines and optimized for user interaction.

## Key Features

1. **Recipe Management with JSON Data**: Displays recipes from a custom JSON file, each card featuring recipe details, ingredients, calories, and preparation time.
2. **Interactive Cooking Queue**: Users can add recipes to their “Want to Cook” list, track selected recipes, and move them to “Currently Cooking” with real-time table updates and limits on duplicates.
3. **Real-Time Nutrition and Time Tracking**: Calculates total calories and preparation time of selected recipes for better meal planning.
